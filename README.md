<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The three MATLAB codes are designed to enable user to perform stochastic simulation of formin mediated filament elongations using experimentally determined parameters.
* The *formin_processivity_steps* program is designed to use experimentally determined probability of formin dissociation per step to stochastically simulate formin mediated filament elongations for 12,000 filaments.
* The *formin_processivity_time* program is designed to use experimentally determined probability of formin dissociation per time to stochastically simulate formin mediated filament elongations for 12,000 filaments.
* The *formin_processivity_prediction* program is designed to stochastically simulate formin mediated filament elongation for user-defined values of fraction FH1 monomer usage along with a series of elongation rates.


The work is supported by NIH and by the Genetics and Cell Biology department of University of Minnesota, Twin-cities.
